# CashFlow Datamaker - ING technical home-take assignment

Being one of the world's largest financial institutions, ING bank provides financial services to clients worldwide. 
Accounts and transactions are the core of these services, and therefore we continuously need to analyze them for
better understanding.

**As the technical home-take assignment, we kindly ask you to develop a _CashFlow Monitoring Application_.**
This application will help end-users to analyze the accounts to which the transactions are linked.

## Assignment

Your task is to create a back-end and front-end application that allows users to monitor cash flows of different 
companies in a user-friendly manner. The application should provide the following features:

* Display a list of all companies.
* Present the financial health of a company in an intuitive and easy-to-understand way.

On the overview page, we would like to see the following information:

* The current cash balance of the company.
* A graph showing historical transactions.
* A map indicating the countries where the company operates the most.

Additional info:

* Consider incorporating graphs, visualisations, and reports to enhance the application.
* Be creative and add any features or functionalities that you believe would be useful for this application.
* Utilise the "small" dataset for implementation.

### Implementation

For backend, feel free to use whichever language/framework you are comfortable with. 
We tend to use Kotlin, Python and Go. 

As for frontend, we expect a modern component-oriented Web app in React. Make sure your code is clean, readable and
with consistent coding styles and formats. 

Nice to have:
* Enable users to download a report of the company's historical transactions in CSV format, given a specific start and end date.
* Containerized solution

Please do not limit yourself to what we can come up with, we love being surprised by your awesome ideas!
